# Good ReadME 5000

  ## Description
  For this project I built an application in the Command Line that generates a readme markdown file for the user
  
  NPM Package Used: Inquirer 
  
  After the user runs "node index.js" in the terminal, they will answer a series of prompts stored in an array labeled "questions"
  
  The writeToFile function will organize all the data and everything will be initalized by the init function
  
  Then the generateMarkdown function will populate all the responses in the ReadME file
